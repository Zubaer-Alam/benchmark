          Based off of the discovery phase, we develop a comprehensive travel plan
          for each client and start working towards delivery. The travel plan is a
          detailed itinerary designed to ensure the most enjoyable travel experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each client is assigned a dedicated travel consultant to keep lines of
          communication open and provide regular updates on the progress of the travel plan.
          They act as a liaison between the clientâ€™s travel dreams and the team who are hard at work 
          crafting the perfect travel experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our travel consultants are trained to promptly reply to client emails, ensuring
          that all questions and concerns are addressed in a timely manner. This reinforces our commitment 
          to excellent customer service and encourages clients to provide feedback.
